## "Timeline" 
Auction’s website that allows users to sell their personal objects (for example clothes, furniture, sports equipment and etc.) at the best possible price. 
Users are divided into 2 types: authorized and unauthorized. Unregistered / unauthorized users have the possibility to browse the website without being able to bid and without being able to create new products. Also, they can look for active products (not archived) and create an account. 

When a registered but anonymous user login to the system, his user type changes to authorized user. This type of user is allowed all the above-mentioned features, except registering a new user. In addition, authenticated / registered users are allowed to access the auctions of purchase / sale. They can create new products. To do this, they need to fill in a form specifying the minimum value of the article and the period during which it is allowed to bid for the product among other data.  If the user wants to change or delete a product that he created, he should go to “My Profile” page, where he has access to these actions. He also has permission to change his own contact information and username.

The user with the highest bid wins and gets the item at that price. The winner will be able to see the seller's contact information in order to communicate about the shipping of the product.
